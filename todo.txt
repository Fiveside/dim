* Archive wishlist: rar, .tar.xz, cbr, 7z.
* On encountering non-image, display bad image error.

* Resize quality is sub-par.
  * Chrome by default uses bilinear?  implement lanczos?
  * Pre-resize future/past images to the destination resolution (may be required if resize is slow)
    * Change page cacheing style to cache paintable displays instead of display components?
      * Would mean invalidating cache on resize.

* Zoom modes:
  * Fit image in window
  * Fit weakest side to window (if taller than window, then fit width, vice versa)
  * Show 100%
  * Mouse wheel to scroll image when larger than window

* Navigate to next or previous file
  * Hotkey: alt+left, alt+right

* Drag and drop to open a new file.

* Bottom slider should probably look something like #13 on this page
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-slider/master/demo/index.html
  Also include thumbnails on hover?

* There's no good error handling for when we encounter a file type
  we don't like.  Display errors properly.
